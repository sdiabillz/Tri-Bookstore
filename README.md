# Tri-Bookstore
Code for a used book selling system
An online used books bookstore that is meant to be used by students from Conestoga College, 
University of Waterloo and Wilfred Laurier University. The website allowed user to insert 
used books for sale and search for used books from all the three institutions. 
The website was developed using ASP.net and Azure cloud storage for its host.
The code can be run locally, but the website is not live anymore.
