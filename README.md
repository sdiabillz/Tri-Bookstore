# Tri-Bookstore
The purpose of this application is to provide a used book selling service for students/faculty who attend Conestoga College, University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. The application will allow users to post, remove, update and search books on the site as well as view the items on sale from the other participating institutions.  Moreover, the system will alleviate the hassle of searching for books elsewhere (other online stores) when students at the same institution use the same books

The college used book sales system is a web based item selling service to sell used books and other school related items. The system will allow users to login in using a valid school email address to access personal accounts.  The site will allow users to create an account used to post items that are for sale and will include features to add, remove, update items, view transaction/purchase history, close accounts and view specific course information if an item is related to a running course. 
The system will incorporate Windows tools and SQLSERVER databases. Communication will be handled via http; a hosting service will be used to permit access from the public net.
